# RAG Chatbot Integration

This document explains how to integrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot into the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Overview

The RAG chatbot allows students to ask questions about the textbook content and receive answers based on the book's information. The system uses vector embeddings to find relevant content and generates responses using an AI model.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Queries**: Ask questions about specific content or the entire book
- **Selected Text Queries**: Select text on a page and ask questions about it specifically
- **Session Management**: Conversations persist across page navigation
- **Source Attribution**: Answers include links to relevant textbook sections
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Integration

The chatbot is integrated into the textbook using a React component that can be embedded in any MDX page:

```jsx
import ChatbotWidget from '@site/src/components/ChatbotWidget';

<ChatbotWidget />
```

## API Endpoints

The chatbot communicates with the backend via these API endpoints:

### Query Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/query`
- Accepts questions and context information
- Returns AI-generated answers with source attribution

### Session Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/session`
- **GET** `/api/session/{session_id}/messages`
- Manage conversation history and persistence

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: React component embedded in Docusaurus pages
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with RAG capabilities
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant for document embeddings
- **Database**: Postgres for session management

## Troubleshooting

If the chatbot is not working:

1. Verify the backend server is running
2. Check that API endpoints are accessible
3. Ensure the Qdrant vector store is configured correctly
4. Confirm that document embeddings have been ingested

## Development

To run the backend server locally:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

To ingest textbook content:

```bash
cd backend/src
python ingest.py
```
