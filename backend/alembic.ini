[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are requested
# to run after the completion of revision file creation.
#
# Format is one of:
#
#   key = value
#
# where key is the name assigned to the hook and value is one of:
#
# 1. The name of a Python function to call.  The function is given
#   the current revision and the list of script directories as arguments.
#
# 2. The absolute path, or relative path to the alembic directory,
#   of a program to run.  The program is given the absolute path
#   of the newly generated revision file as an argument.
#
# Examples:
#
#   hooks = black, isort
#   black.type = exec
#   black.executable = black
#   black.options = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
#   isort.type = exec
#   isort.executable = isort
#   isort.options = -rc REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
